### Hi everyone


Myself Raghupathi Reddy Rupanagudi, a Master's graduate from Northwest Missouri State University, specializing in Applied Computer Science.

As a seasoned MERN stack developer with around 5 years of experience, I excel in designing and developing dynamic web applications. My expertise spans creating REST APIs using Node.js and AWS services, including EC2, Lambda, and DynamoDB. I have a strong command of MongoDB for schema design and querying, along with React for building responsive single-page applications. Utilizing Redux for state management and Socket.IO for web socket programming, I ensure robust, scalable, and real-time web solutions. My proficiency extends to agile methodologies, Git version control, and front-end technologies like HTML5, CSS3, and SASS/LESS, enabling efficient collaboration and seamless integration.

With expertise in the MERN stack, I am actively seeking full-time positions to contribute my skills and drive innovation in web development.
